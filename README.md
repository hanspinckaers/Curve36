A diodeless 36 key split wireless keyboard with Choc V1 switches based off of the [LambBT](https://github.com/johnlamb/LambBT) and inspired by the rae-dux.  

Everything has splay, including the index finger, which is also shifted downwards to sit between ring and pinky fingers in terms of height.
The index finger adjustments try to address the fact that men usually have longer ring than index fingers, as well as hands typically being slightly tilted while typing (due to the thumb pushing the hand up on flat keyboards), which causes the index to flare inwards.  
  
Thumb splay is a bit less aggressive than on other keyboards, as I personally noticed my thumbs to prefer slightly more lateral movement.
I also tried to avoid underreaching, while not moving the outer thumb key too far away.
