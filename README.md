This is a diodeless, 36 key, split (reversible PCB), wireless keyboard with Choc V1 switches, based off of the [Keiler](https://github.com/jonathanforking/Keiler) 

Everything has splay, including the index finger. Some columns are slightly curved to follow the movement my fingers make while typing.

I'm not super happy with the amount of underreach the innermost thumb key has.
